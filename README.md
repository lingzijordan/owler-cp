# Please use following commands:
*  `yarn` to install dependencies
*  `yarn start` to start the application in dev.
*  `yarn run build && yarn run start:prod` to start the application in production.
 
# current status
*  Basic skelton/Graphs ready.
*  The appliction currently loads in 4-6s in development mode 2-3s in production and <1s for refresh (appliction dosn't have much of graphics till now, but with graphs and Images required).
*  Till now I have focused mostly on more moduler architecture and every container have it's own actions/reducers/selectors/sagas etc, so that it will now be very easier to proceed further and if anything comes in between it will be super easy to add remove things.
